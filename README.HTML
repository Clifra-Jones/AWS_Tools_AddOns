<h2 id="helper-functions-for-working-with-aws-in-powershell">Helper
functions for working with AWS in Powershell</h2>
<p>These functions were created for working with AWS in PowerShell.</p>
<p>1/11/2024: Added 2 additional function to store AWS Access Keys in a
Secure Vault. Set-SecretVault Set-Secure-AwsCredentials</p>
<p>10/29/2024: Added additional properties to the object returned by
Get-EC2INstanceList</p>
<p>See the module reference for details.</p>

<p>[!NOTE] This module is a continuous work in progress. You should
watch this repository for any published changes.</p>
<p>The module version will be incremented when changes are published to
the Powershell Gallery.</p>

<h3 id="aws-s3-helper-functions">AWS S3 Helper Functions</h3>
<p>AWS S3 does not have the concept of folders. While browsing S3
buckets in the AWS console it appears the show folder you can drill down
into, these are not actually folders in the Windows Explorer sense. They
are just a common prefix that an object has.</p>
<p>For example: An object listed in the console as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Folder1
<ul>
<li>Folder2
<ul>
<li>file.txt</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Actually has the object key as /Folder1/Folder2/file.txt</p>
<p>The Get-S3Object function in the AWS.Tools.S3 module will return ALL
object that match the provided prefix. So in our example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode powershell"><code class="sourceCode powershell"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Get<span class="op">-</span>S3Object <span class="op">-</span>BucketName mybucket <span class="op">-</span>Prefix Folder1\</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Will return all objects with a prefix beginning with ‘Folder1’. In
our example that may not be bad but in an S3 bucket with hundreds or
thousands of objects with many longer prefixes this becomes very
cumbersome to find the object(s) you are looking for.</p>
<p>The Get-S3Folder function lets you return ONLY the object that share
a common prefix at the level of the provided prefix.</p>
<p>With our example above.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
class="sourceCode powershell"><code class="sourceCode powershell"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Get<span class="op">-</span>S3Folder <span class="op">-</span>BucketName mybucket <span class="op">-</span>Prefix Folder1</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Will return an array containing one key object with the value:
Folder1/Folder2</p>
<p>The command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre
class="sourceCode powershell"><code class="sourceCode powershell"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Get<span class="op">-</span>S3Folder <span class="op">-</span>BucketName mybucket <span class="op">-</span>Prefix Folder1\Folder2</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Will return an array containing one Key objects with the value:
Folder1/Folder2/file.txt</p>
<p>This makes it easy to find objects or prefixes you are looking for.
Lets say you have an S3 bucket with thousands of objects with very deep
prefixes. Now you want to find the prefix under the ‘projects’ “folder”
that contains “Highway-196”. You can do that with the following:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre
class="sourceCode powershell"><code class="sourceCode powershell"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Get<span class="op">-</span>S3Folder <span class="op">-</span>BucketName projectfiles <span class="op">-</span>Prefix projects <span class="op">|</span> <span class="fu">Where-Object</span> <span class="op">{</span><span class="va">$_</span><span class="op">.</span><span class="fu">Key</span> <span class="op">-</span>like <span class="st">&quot;*Highway-196*&quot;</span><span class="op">}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This returns a single key object with the value:
projects/Highway-196-Project”</p>
<p>Another issue with the standard S3 functions is restoring S3 objects
from Glacier. The Restore-S3Object function can only restore a single
object. While you could gather an array of objects and pipe them to this
command that could get tedious. The Restore-S3Folder function makes this
quite easy.</p>
<p>Using the “Highway 196” example above. We now know that the common
prefix value for the Highway 196 project files is
“projects/Highway-196-Project”</p>
<p>So to restore all the objects that have a common prefix (are in the
folder and sub-folders) “Highway-196-Project” We would do:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre
class="sourceCode powershell"><code class="sourceCode powershell"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Restore<span class="op">-</span>S3Folder <span class="op">-</span>BucketName projectfiles <span class="op">-</span>Prefix <span class="st">&#39;projects/Highway-196-Project&#39;</span> <span class="op">-</span>CopyLifeTime 90 <span class="op">-</span>Tier Standard</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Where CopyLifeTime is the number of days to keep the items in the
restored storage class and Tier is the storage class to restore the
items to.</p>
<p>Standard Glacier restores can take up to 4 hours while deep glacier
restores can take 12-24 hours. So, before you can download the items you
need to know if the restore has completed. This again is not easy with
the standard functions. So now we can use Get-S3RestoreProgress.</p>
<p>For our example above:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre
class="sourceCode powershell"><code class="sourceCode powershell"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Get<span class="op">-</span>S3RestoreProgress <span class="op">-</span>BucketName projectfiles <span class="op">-</span>Prefix <span class="st">&#39;projects/Highway-196-Project&#39;</span> </span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will return an array of objects for each object with the common
prefix (In the folder and sub-folders) with these properties.</p>

<h3 id="ec2-helper-functions">EC2 Helper Functions</h3>
<h4 id="get-ec2instancelist">Get-EC2InstanceList</h4>
<p>This function returns a list of custom EC2 Instance objects with
valuable information about the instance. This information is gathered
from many sources that the standard EC2 Instance object does not
contain.</p>
<h3 id="iam-helper-functions">IAM Helper Functions</h3>
<p>There are 3 functions for getting the permissions (inline and
attached Policies) assigned to IAM Users, Groups, and Roles</p>
<ul>
<li>Get-IAMUserPermissions</li>
<li>Get-IAMGroupPermissions</li>
<li>Get-IAMRolePermissions</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="secure-access-key-storage-functions">Secure Access Key Storage
Functions</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>[!IMPORTANT] These functions were created to enable our staff to use
AWS Access Keys in a more secure fashion. We have since moved on to
using Identity Center SSO for interactive sessions.</p>
<p>As noted below the credential process will hang if the vault has a
password. This makes this process unsafe for interactive sessions.</p>
<p>We have determined that the credential process defined in the AWS
credential file is problematic.</p>
<p>A more stable approach for automation is to retrieve the access keys
from the local secrets store and apply them using Set-AWSCredential.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>$Creds = Get-Secret MyAWSKeys -AsPlainText | ConvertFrom-JSON</p>
<p>Set-AWSCredential -AccessKey $Creds.AccessKey -SecretAccessKey
$Creds.SecretAccessKey</p>
<p>Subsequent commands will run under these credentials</p>
<p>This method does not depend of storing anything in the local
credential file.</p>
<p>These methods will most likely be depreciated in future releases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are 2 functions that facilitate creating secured AWS Access
keys.</p>
<ul>
<li>Set-SecretVault</li>
<li>Set-SecureAWSCredentials</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that you cannot set the vault to require a password if
you are using this vault for secure access keys. This will cause the
process to hang when trying to retrieve the keys. You must set
Authentication and Interaction to ‘none’.</p>
<p>See the <a
href="https://clifra-jones.github.io/AWS_Tools_AddOns/docs/reference.html">Module
reference</a> for more details on these functions.</p>
